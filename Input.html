        <!-- The Early Days -->
        <h2>The Early Days</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Marc, and I was born on April 18, 2006. My earliest memories as a child are filled with a sense of freedom and adventure, albeit tinged with a hint of neglect. I vividly recall the times when I couldn't go outside to play. In those moments, I would wait for my dad, Michael Ricafort, to fall asleep so I could sneak out into the world. Those were some of the happiest times of my life—carefree and unburdened by responsibility. I felt loved and free, often wishing I could be a bird soaring through the sky, embodying the very essence of freedom.</p>

        <!-- Discovering My Passion -->
        <h2>Discovering My Passion</h2>
        <p>From an early age, I discovered my passion for the arts. My first sketches were of anime and cartoon characters, and I spent countless hours drawing and creating. Alongside art, I loved to sing, climb trees, and play outside. My creativity knew no bounds; I remember constructing slingshots from scratch and folding intricate origami figures. While I was bright and imaginative, school wasn’t always my favorite place. I struggled with writing and often found myself disconnected from the academic environment.</p>

        <!-- Challenges of Childhood -->
        <h2>Challenges of Childhood</h2>
        <p>Life wasn’t always a bed of roses. There were darker times when I had to confront responsibilities that felt overwhelming. My childhood was marked by a sense of neglect; my grandmother often gambled and wasn’t home much, while my mom worked as an overseas foreign worker (OFW). Although I was spoiled and grew up in a wealthy household, I often felt a void—a longing for a stable family life where everything felt right. As a child, it was easy to blame others for my feelings of discontent without recognizing the struggles my parents faced.</p>

        <!-- Family Struggles and Rebuilding -->
        <h2>Family Struggles and Rebuilding</h2>
        <p>As time passed, the carefree days began to fade. My mother, Jennilyn, experienced depression and had to return from afar to care for me after my father’s infidelity came to light. At that young age, I didn’t fully grasp the complexities of adult relationships; all I knew was that family mattered above all else. However, rebuilding that family proved to be a daunting task. We moved frequently to escape gossip and rebuild our lives, but this only deepened my feelings of isolation.</p>

        <!-- Loss and Isolation -->
        <h2>Loss and Isolation</h2>
        <p>Making friends became increasingly difficult as I grew older. It wasn’t until I met my best friend that things began to improve; she reignited my creativity and brought joy back into my life. Unfortunately, that happiness was short-lived when she passed away unexpectedly. This loss left me feeling even more disconnected from the world around me.</p>

        <!-- The Pandemic and Struggles with Loneliness -->
        <h2>The Pandemic and Struggles with Loneliness</h2>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated my feelings of loneliness and alienation. Surrounded by people yet feeling utterly alone, it seemed like no one understood what I was going through. During this time, reaching out for help felt impossible; I feared being seen as a burden rather than someone in need of support.</p>

        <!-- Embracing New Hobbies -->
        <h2>Embracing New Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Despite these challenges, I refused to give up on myself. After high school, I began exploring new hobbies—playing instruments and gaming helped me cope with my feelings of isolation. Although these activities provided some relief, they couldn’t fill the void left by the lack of meaningful connections.</p>

        <!-- A New Beginning in College -->
        <h2>A New Beginning in College</h2>
        <p>Now in college, I'm finally starting to embrace my true self again. The journey has been long and fraught with challenges, but I'm learning to let go of past burdens and rediscover the happiness that once defined me. As I document this part of my life, I'm hopeful for what lies ahead—ready to embrace new friendships and experiences while nurturing my creative spirit once more.</p>
